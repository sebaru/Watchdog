The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;

If you're in the wrong mode, you might be able to
return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.
